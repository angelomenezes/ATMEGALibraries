# AVR-ATMEGA Libraries

This repository gathers some small libraries that were written to extend functionalities of ATmega MCUs (ATmega328P, ATmega2560, ...) with specific electronic parts. The code presented here can be expanded easily to other MCUs, and used with other similar versions of the electronic parts.
